# Uber Ride Requests Sample App

This app demonstrates a basic implementation of the Uber Ride Request API. To run on your local machine, follow these steps after cloning the repository (make sure you have [Rails installed](http://installrails.com/)):

1. Change directory: `cd riderequest/`
2. Install dependencies with `bundle install`
3. Run server with `bundle exec rails s`
4. Now, you should be able to go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser and test out the app yourself!
